# Data Structures in TypeScript

This project aims to demonstrate how to implement various data structures using TypeScript. It includes a collection of fundamental data structures such as Linked Lists, Graphs, Trees, Heaps, Sets, Stacks, and Queues.

## Project Contents

- **Linked List**: Implementation of a linked list with basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.
- **Graph**: Implementation of a graph with methods to add vertices and edges, and to find paths.
- **Tree**: Implementation of a binary tree with basic operations like adding and removing nodes.
- **Heap**: Implementation of a heap data structure with basic operations like inserting and extracting elements.
- **Set**: Implementation of a set with operations such as adding and removing elements.
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure with basic operations like push and pop.
- **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure with operations like enqueue and dequeue.

## How to Run

To ensure everything works correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Install TypeScript**:
